# Dotsama wallet react

Highly opinionated Dotsama react wallet.

A lot of the code is taken from [Subwallet](https://github.com/Koniverse/SubWallet-Extension) and [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/)

Opinionated because:

- uses [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for UI and styling.
- uses [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management

[Example use](../example-nextjs/pages/index.tsx)
